Objetivos
------------

* **Instruir de manera simple** — .

* **Everything on a single page** — Gone are the days when your users had to search through a million pages to find what they wanted. Slate puts the entire documentation on a single page. We haven't sacrificed linkability, though. As you scroll, your browser's hash will update to the nearest header, so linking to a particular point in the documentation is still natural and easy.

You can view more in [the list on the wiki](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Slate-in-the-Wild).
